# arm_assembly_python_transcompiler
Compiles arm assembly language to python and shows you results of running the program by printing the registers after each instruction is executed.

Run "python simulator.py my_text.txt" to run your arm program, with each command on a different line. Take a look at the iq 30 divide demo for an example.
Note that only a subset of arm instructions are currently implemented!
